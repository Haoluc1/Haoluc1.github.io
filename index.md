I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 part 1
I liked this lab because it was my first time ever coding and it was a simple project. It was just replacing “World” with your name. This project was an introduction to C++ and it would lead to me to learn more about c++. 

* Lab 4 part 2
I liked lab 4 part 2 because we were making a guessing game. It was when a player had a number in mind and the other player had to guess what the number was. This is when I started to learn how to use the if or else statement. 

* Lab 7 part 2
This lab was my favorite as well. In this lab, my partner and I had to use the bool function to create the lab. This lab was about parking and restrictions on parking in certain areas at certain times.
